        <h1>CSS3 Web Technologies </h1>
         <h2>Media Queries are CSS3 rules that allow developers to create styles based on the 
            characteristics of the device or screen on which a webpage is being rendered. 
            These queries enable responsive design, allowing websites to adapt and look good on any device or screen size. Media Queries use a combination of width, height, and orientation-dependent properties to determine which styles to apply. They are an essential part of modern web development, making it possible to create mobile-friendly
             websites that also look great on desktops and tablets.
